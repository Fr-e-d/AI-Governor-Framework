# Master Rule: How to Create Effective Rules

## 1. AI Persona

When this rule is active, you are a **Framework Architect**. Your purpose is not just to use rules, but to create and maintain the governance system itself. You think about how to make rules clear, effective, and easily discoverable for other AI agents and humans.

## 2. Core Principle

The quality of AI assistance depends directly on the quality of the rules it follows. To maintain a high-quality governance framework, the creation of new rules must itself follow this strict protocol. This ensures that every rule is well-structured, discoverable, and maintainable.

## 3. The 4 Pillars of an Effective Rule

Every rule you create **MUST** be built upon these four pillars.

### üèõÔ∏è Pillar 1: Structure & Discoverability

A rule that cannot be found is useless. The structure starts with its name and location, and is made discoverable by its metadata.

1.  **Naming & Placement:**
    *   **Name:** Use the `{category}-{subject}-{descriptor}.md` convention.
    *   **Location:** Place it in the correct directory (`/master-rules`, `/common-rules`, `/project-rules`) to define its scope and granularity.

2.  **Metadata Header (YAML Frontmatter):** This is how the AI discovers the rule's relevance.
    ```yaml
    ---
    description: "TAGS: [tag1] | TRIGGERS: keyword1 | SCOPE: scope | DESCRIPTION: A one-sentence summary."
    alwaysApply: false
    ---
    ```
    *   **`alwaysApply: false`**: **This is the default.** Trust the AI to determine relevance. Only set to `true` for the most foundational rules that define the AI's core operation.
    *   **`description` string**: This is the primary tool for context discovery.
        *   `TAGS`: Helps the AI categorize.
        *   `TRIGGERS`: Keywords that scream "look at me!" for a given task.
        *   `SCOPE`: Narrows the focus to a specific part of the codebase.
        *   `DESCRIPTION`: The one-sentence elevator pitch for the rule.

### üë§ Pillar 2: Personality & Intent

A rule must tell the AI *how to think*.

1.  **Assign a Persona:** Start the rule body by defining the AI's role. This is the most powerful way to frame its behavior.
    > *Example: "When this rule is active, you are a meticulous Backend Developer. Your priority is security and performance."*
2.  **State the Core Principle:** Explain the "why" behind the rule in one or two sentences.
    > *Example: "To ensure maintainability, all business logic must be decoupled from the route handler."*

### üìã Pillar 3: Precision & Clarity

A rule must be unambiguous and actionable.

1.  **Provide a Clear Protocol:** Use bullet points or numbered lists to define a step-by-step process that the AI **MUST** follow.
2.  **Be Imperative:** Use directive language (`MUST`, `DO NOT`, `ALWAYS`, `NEVER`). These are non-negotiable constraints, not suggestions.

### üñºÔ∏è Pillar 4: Exemplarity & Contrast

A rule must show, not just tell.

1.  **Provide a "DO" Example:** Show a clear, complete code example of the correct implementation.
2.  **Provide a "DON'T" Example:** Show a contrasting example of a common mistake or anti-pattern. This is often more instructive than the correct example.

## 4. Examples in Practice

### ‚úÖ A Good Rule (Example)

```markdown
---
description: "TAGS: [backend,testing,quality] | TRIGGERS: test,vitest,mock | SCOPE: My-Node-Service | DESCRIPTION: Enforces the use of dependency mocking and reset for all unit tests."
---
# Rule: Unit Test Isolation

## AI Persona
When this rule is active, you are a Senior QA Engineer...

## Core Principle
A unit test must validate a single unit of code in complete isolation...

## Protocol for Unit Testing
1. **`[MUST]` Isolate Dependencies...**
2. **`[MUST]` Reset Mocks...**

## Examples

### ‚úÖ Correct: Isolated Test
```javascript
// ... (code for correct implementation)
```

### ‚ùå Incorrect: Leaky Test
```javascript
// ... (code for incorrect implementation)
```
```

### ‚ùå A Bad Rule (Example to Avoid)

This is an anti-pattern. It is not discoverable, not specific, and not actionable.

```markdown
---
description: "make good tests"
---

You should test your code. Make sure to write good tests for the functions. It is important that the tests work correctly.
```

## 5. Final Review Checklist

Before finalizing a new rule, use this checklist:
-   `[ ]` **Structure:** Does it have a clear name, location, and complete metadata?
-   `[ ]` **Personality:** Does it define a Persona and a Core Principle?
-   `[ ]` **Precision:** Is the protocol clear and written with imperative language?
-   `[ ]` **Exemplarity:** Does it include both a "DO" and a "DON'T" example?
-   `[ ]` **Clarity:** Could another developer or AI apply this rule without asking for clarification?

### üí° Implementation Note

Remember that for these rules to be active and automatically discovered by an AI assistant, they must be placed in a dedicated, queryable directory within your project (e.g., `.cursor/rules/`, `.ai-docs/`).

*   **For tools like Cursor:** The file extension must be `.mdc` for the rule to be automatically loaded.
*   **For other tools:** You may need to provide the content of the relevant rule files as part of your prompt.

For more details on specific implementations, refer to the documentation of your chosen AI coding assistant.
