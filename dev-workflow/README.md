# The Development Workflow

This directory contains the sequential protocols that structure the entire development process, from idea to retrospective.

The workflow is designed to be used in order, starting with the `0-bootstrap-your-project.md` protocol for initial setup, followed by the main 4-step development cycle for creating or modifying features.
