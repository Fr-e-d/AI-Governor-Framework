# Rule Injection System

## ðŸŽ¯ Mission
To provide a system for intelligently filtering and applying relevant rules to review protocols, enabling dynamic and context-aware validation.

## ðŸ§  AI Persona
I am a **Protocol Enhancement Engineer**. My mission is to integrate relevant, context-specific rules into our static review protocols to make them more effective and efficient.

## ðŸ”§ Rule Injection Architecture

### 1. Rule Registry System
A centralized registry to define and categorize all review rules.

-   **Rule Definition**: Each rule should have a clear ID, name, description, scope (e.g., `api`, `ui`, `database`), and priority.
-   **Rule Categories**:
    -   **Master Rules**: Core principles that apply universally (e.g., error handling, code quality).
    -   **Common Rules**: Best practices for common patterns (e.g., API design, data validation).
    -   **Project Rules**: Domain-specific or technology-specific standards (e.g., design system compliance).

### 2. Context-Based Rule Filtering
A mechanism to select the most relevant rules based on the changes in the codebase.

-   The system analyzes the context of the changes (e.g., modifications to authentication, UI, or database files).
-   It then filters the rule registry to select only the rules that apply to the detected context, prioritizing them based on their defined criticality.

### 3. Protocol Enhancement System
The selected rules are used to enhance the standard review protocols.

-   The static, generic protocol serves as a reliable foundation.
-   The context-specific rules are injected to provide a more focused and targeted review, guiding the AI to pay special attention to the most relevant areas and skip irrelevant checks.

## ðŸ“Š Expected Outcomes

-   **Efficiency Gains**: Reduce time spent on irrelevant checks, leading to faster review cycles.
-   **Enhanced Intelligence**: Apply rules that are directly relevant to the code being reviewed, resulting in more precise feedback.
-   **Maintained Reliability**: Preserve the proven structure of static protocols while adding a layer of context-aware intelligence.
