# The Governor Framework
### The Keystone for AI-Driven Code

**Stop fighting your AI assistant. Start governing it.**

Tired of AI-generated code that's buggy, inconsistent, and ignores your architecture? The Governor Framework is a safe, plug-and-play system designed to teach your AI your project's unique DNA. It provides a set of rules and workflows to turn any AI assistant from a chaotic tool into a disciplined engineering partner that respects your architectural decisions, best practices, and non-negotiable constraints.

Reclaim control. Enforce your coding standards. Ship with confidence.

## ‚ú® The Philosophy: From Prompting & Fixing to Governing
This approach is rooted in one core principle: **Context Engineering**.

This isn't about bigger prompts or dumping your entire codebase into one, which is both ineffective and expensive. It's about giving the AI the *right information* at the *right time*. This framework achieves that by building a knowledge base of robust `rules` (the orders) and architectural `READMEs` (the context) that the AI consults on-demand.

This is how we shift from the endless loop of **prompting and fixing** to strategic **Governing**.

## üöÄ How It Works: Two Core Components

The Governor Framework is composed of two distinct but complementary parts:

| Component | What It Is | How It's Used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Governance Engine** (`/rules`) | A set of powerful, passive rules that run in the background. | Your AI assistant discovers and applies these rules **automatically** to ensure quality and consistency. |
| **The Operator's Playbook** (`/dev-workflow`) | A set of active, step-by-step protocols for the entire development lifecycle. | You **manually** invoke these protocols to guide the AI through complex tasks like planning and implementation. |

#### At a Glance: The 5-Step Operator's Playbook
> The framework is built around a series of sequential protocols that move a feature from idea to production with clarity and control:
> -   0Ô∏è‚É£ **Bootstrap:** Turns a generic AI into a project-specific expert.
> -   1Ô∏è‚É£ **Define:** Transforms an idea into a detailed PRD.
> -   2Ô∏è‚É£ **Plan:** Converts the PRD into a step-by-step technical plan.
> -   3Ô∏è‚É£ **Implement:** Executes the plan with human validation at each step.
> -   4Ô∏è‚É£ **Improve:** Audits the code to make the AI smarter for the future.
