# The Governor Framework
### The Keystone for AI-Driven Code

**Stop fighting your AI assistant. Start governing it.**

Tired of AI-generated code that's buggy, inconsistent, and ignores your architecture? The Governor Framework turns your coding assistant from a chaotic code-suggester into a disciplined, project-aware engineering partner.

Reclaim control. Enforce your coding standards. Ship with confidence.

## üöÄ Quick Start: Get Value in 2 Minutes

1.  **Create Your Project from the Template:**
    Click the green **"Use this template"** button at the top of this page and select **"Create a new repository"**. This will create your own copy of the framework, ready to be customized.

2.  **Bootstrap Your Project:**
    Once you have your new repository, clone it locally. Open your AI assistant inside the project and give it this command:
    ```
    Apply instructions from dev-workflow/0-bootstrap-your-project.md
    ```
    The AI will now analyze your codebase and configure the framework for you.

3.  **Build Your First Feature:**
    You are now ready to develop with a context-aware AI. Use the structured workflow to define, plan, and implement your first feature:
    ```
    Apply instructions from /path/to/The-Governor-Framework/dev-workflow/1-create-prd.md

    Here's the feature I want to build: [Describe your feature]
    ```

## ‚ú® The Philosophy: From Prompting to Governing

The key to unlocking an AI's full potential is **Context Engineering**.

This isn't about bigger prompts. It's about giving the AI the *right information* at the *right time*. This framework provides a lightweight yet powerful structure to achieve that by:

1.  **Decomposing Complexity:** Breaking large features into small, focused tasks.
2.  **Codifying Knowledge:** Building a library of rules and `READMEs` that the AI can consult on-demand.
3.  **Evolving Continuously:** Treating your "Context Kit" as a living system that gets smarter with every feature you ship.

This framework helps you shift from simple **prompting** to strategic **governing**, turning your AI assistant into a true "Companion Expert."

## üóÇÔ∏è What's Inside?

This repository contains two core components:

*   **`/dev-workflow/`**: A set of sequential protocols that guide you and the AI through the entire development lifecycle, from idea to production.
    *   ‚û°Ô∏è **[Discover the Workflow (`dev-workflow/README.md`)](./dev-workflow/README.md)**
*   **`/rules/`**: A powerful, three-layer governance system that allows you to codify your project's architectural decisions, best practices, and constraints.
    *   ‚û°Ô∏è **[Master the Rules (`rules/README.md`)](./rules/README.md)**
