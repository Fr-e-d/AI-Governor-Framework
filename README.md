# AI Dev Assistant Framework

A pragmatic, plug-and-play governance framework for AI-assisted software development. It is designed to work with any modern AI coding assistant, from IDE-integrated tools like [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) and GitHub Copilot to conversational agents like Claude. This framework excels in complex, multi-codebase monorepos, transforming AI assistants from simple code generators into structured, context-aware engineering partners.

It provides a set of structured Markdown files‚Äîprotocols and rules‚Äîthat guide an AI through the entire development lifecycle, from initial codebase analysis to continuous improvement.

## üåü The Philosophy: Context is King

Working with AI assistants reveals one core truth: **Context is King.** üëë

However, "context" isn't just about dumping more data into the prompt. In complex codebases, that approach is inefficient and prohibitively expensive. üí∏

True **Context Engineering** is a strategy. It‚Äôs about giving the AI the *right* information, at the *right* time. This framework is built on four core principles to achieve that:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Decompose Complexity:** Break big features into small, focused tasks to improve AI accuracy.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Enable Targeted Access:** Build a knowledge base of rules & `READMEs` for precise, on-demand context.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Keep Humans in the Loop:** Supervise the AI like a brilliant junior developer and validate at key checkpoints.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Evolve Context Continuously:** Treat context as a living system that grows with your code and makes the AI smarter over time.

This framework shifts the paradigm from simple **prompting** to strategic **governing**, transforming any AI assistant into a true "Companion Expert" that understands your project's unique standards.

## üöÄ The "Companion Expert" Workflow

This framework is designed to turn your AI assistant into a **companion expert** that learns and grows with your project. The workflow is simple:

1.  **Bootstrap Your Project (One-Time Setup):** Run the `0-bootstrap-your-project.md` protocol. The AI will analyze your codebase and work with you to create a foundational "Context Kit" of `READMEs` and project-specific rules.
2.  **Develop Features:** Use the main 4-step development workflow (starting with `1-create-prd.md`) to create or modify features. The AI will now be significantly more accurate because it uses the context you built together.
3.  **Evolve the Context:** With each feature you build, the AI will get smarter. Use the `4-implementation-retrospective.md` protocol to identify gaps and continuously enrich your project's rules and documentation.

### A Note on the First Run: The Learning Curve

Your first few interactions with the AI using this framework might require more corrections and clarifications. **This is normal and by design.** You are actively *teaching* the assistant the specific nuances of your codebase.

Think of it as onboarding a new junior developer. The initial investment in teaching pays off exponentially. With each iteration, the AI's context gets richer, its proposals become more accurate, and it evolves from a generic tool into a true expert companion for your project.

## üóÇÔ∏è Framework Structure

-   **`/dev-workflow/`**: Contains the sequential protocols that guide the development process from idea to retrospective.
-   **`/rules/`**: Contains a starter kit of foundational "Master Rules" that govern the AI's behavior and thinking process.
